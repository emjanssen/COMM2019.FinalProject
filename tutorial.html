                        <li>This mount will be attached to the back of your monitor, and it will connect to a separate
                            arm mount, which
                            you'll then fasten to your desk.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You'll want to check the weight capacity for the mount, and make sure it can hold up the
                            monitor
                            you're purchasing.</li>
                        <li>Make sure it has a 360 degree rotation option, so you can position your monitor however
                            you'd like.</li>

                        <li>Please follow any assembly instructions included with your monitor and arm mount products.
