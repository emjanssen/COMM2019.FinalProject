            <li>Acquire a monitor with a mount.
                <ul>
                    <li>Since you won't be setting your monitor on top of your desk, you'll need a monitor with a VESA mount.</li>
                    <img src="images//profileCardProfiIeImage.jpg" alt="Image Placeholder">
                    <li>This mount will connect to an arm, which you'll then fasten to your desk.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Acquire a VESA arm mount.
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll want to check the weight capacity for it, and make sure it can hold up the monitor you're purchasing.</li>
                    <li>Make sure it has a 360 degree rotation option, so you can position your monitor however you'd like.</li>

            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>You'll need it to connect between your monitor and your computer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once you have your monitor and mount, assemble them as directed by your specific products.
                <ul>
                    <li>Each of these products will likely have their own little bit of assembly, before you connect them together or set them up at your desk.</li>
                    <li>Please follow any assembly instructions included with your products.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Connect the mount to your desk, or some other solid surface.
                <ul>
                    <li>Put one side of the mount under your desk edge, and side of it above your desk edge.</li>
