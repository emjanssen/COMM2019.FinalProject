        <h1>How To Set Up A Vertical Monitor For Your Computer</h1>
        <ol id="instructions-ol-level-one">
            <li>Acquire a monitor with a mount.
                <ul id="instructions-ul-level-two">
                    <li>Since you won't be setting your monitor on top of your desk, you'll need a monitor with a VESA mount.</li>
                    <li>image placeholder: vesa mount</li>
                    <li>This mount will connect to an arm, which you'll then fasten to your desk.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Acquire a VESA arm mount.
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll want to check the weight capacity for it, and make sure it can hold up the monitor you're purchasing.</li>
                    <li>Make sure it has a 360 degree rotation option, so you can position your monitor however you'd like.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Acquire an HDMI cord.
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll need it to connect between your monitor and your computer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once you have your monitor and mount, assemble them as directed by your specific products.
                <ul>
                    <li>Each of these products will likely have their own little bit of assembly, before you connect them together or set them up at your desk.</li>
                    <li>Please follow any assembly instructions included with your products.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Connect the mount to your desk, or some other solid surface.
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll be putting one side of the mount under your desk edge, one above your desk edge, and then screwing the connector until the mount is secured tightly to your desk.</li>
                    <li>Move the arm mount until the VESA mount part is where you would like your monitor to sit.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Connect the monitor to the mount.
                <ul>
                    <li>Slide the monitor into the mount, so the VESA pieces interlock.</li>
                    <li>Screw in the screws to keep the monitor in place.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Connect an HDMI cord between the monitor and your PC.
                <ul>
                    <li>Find an HDMI port on your monitor.</li>
                    <li>Plug the HDMI cord into that port, and connect the other end of the cord to an HDMI port on your PC.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Change the monitor orientation to vertical.
                <ul>
                    <li>On Windows, select Start, then to go to > Settings > System > Display.</li>
                    <li>Find the 'Rearrange Your Displays' section.</li>
                    <li>Select the relevant monitor. You can press identify to show you which number corresponds with which monitor (a number will briefly show up on your monitor screen).</li>
                    <li>Scroll down to 'Orientation', and select 'Portrait (flipped)' from the dropdown options.</li>
                    <li>If you're using a different operating system, please find corresponding monitor orientation instructions for your operating system.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
